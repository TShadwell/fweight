Framework Eight is a router and server for the Go language that focuses on speed and semantics.

Framework eight is currently __alpha__ software: layer2 (the MIME management layer) is unfinished and the current API is subject to change.

In addition, some of the documentation is from previous revisions of the software.

Current (and partially wong) documentation: http://godoc.org/github.com/TShadwell/fweight
